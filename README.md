# fightgame-revamped
i remade the fight game in C# after taking a break.

- You can fight or defend against your enemy
- or if you're a coward, then just run away.
- I made this game to practice on C#.
- The revamped version is just me attempting to do it again after taking a break, i tried some different methods aswell while coding like the while <70 and == 70 easter egg
